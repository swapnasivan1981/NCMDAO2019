empty line space between the title of the paper and the author(s), one empty line between the 
author(s) and the affiliation(s) of author(s), one empty line space above the abstract heading, 
and one empty line between the abstract and keywords. The abstract must be uploaded in PDF file format 
as per the instructions given in www.ncmdao.org. \\
\noindent The abstract should typically include the following sections:
\begin{enumerate}

			\item Objectives of the current work
		\end{itemize}
	\item Problem Definition and Formulation

\noindent Some important points to bear in mind:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The novelty and originality of the work should be clearly highlighted.
	\item Minimum details in the form of figures, equations, references, and tables may be included in the
	 abstract to enable reviewers to make an informed assessment of the abstract. 
	\item The abstract should preferably target one or more of the areas outlined in the call for papers.
	\item Key results should be included in the abstract. If final results are not yet obtained, then at least some preliminary results should be provided.
	\item The abstract should have been spell-checked and grammar checked. Well written clear and concise abstracts improve the chances of getting selected.
	\item Plagiarism will not be accepted in any form and is a ground for rejection of the abstract.
\end{itemize}
\noindent The abstract will be primarily used for screening based on points mentioned above. In addition it 
will also be used to plan the schedule of the conference and group the papers.\\
